    "## Signal formats\n",
    "\n",
    "NeuroOn signal was obtained by using proprietary Intelclinic's scripts I am not allowed to share. They produced four CSV files, containing respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    " - EEG signal (125 Hz)\n",
    " - accelerometer signal\n",
    " - LED activity\n",
    " - Staging ([hypnogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnogram))\n",
    "\n",
    "AURA PSG signal was exported to an EDF format using Grass Technologies PSG TWin 4.5.4 and 4.5.2 to minimize the risk of software-derived artifacts. The channels signals include:\n",
    "\n",
    " - EOG1-A1\n",
    " - EOG2-A1\n",
    " - CHIN1-CHIN2\n",
    " - CHIN2-CHIN3\n",
    " - F3-A2\n",
    " - C3-A2\n",
    " - O1-A2\n",
    " - F4-A1\n",
    " - C4-A1\n",
    " - O2-A1\n",
    " - SNORE (first night only)\n",
    " - FLOW (first night only)\n",
    " - CHEST (first night only)\n",
    " - ABDOMEN (first night only)\n",
    " - ECG (first night only)\n",
    " - SaO2 (blood oxygen saturation, first night only)\n",
    " - HR (heart rate, first night only)\n",

    "\n",
    "Since proper comparative analysis of NeuroOn's and AURA's signals would require an immense amount of work, I'd like to start with comparing their hypnograms."

    "## Time synchronisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypnogram comparison requires us to synchronise signals from both devices in time. With NeuroOn operating in debug mode there was no way I know of to place markers, leaving us with no easy way to sync. To counter that, for the first several minutes of PSG recording I repeatedly clenched my jaw and moved my eyebrows to introduce muscle artifacts to both signals, allowing me to synchronise both afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, the latest version of software I was given by Intelclinic supports recovering timestamps from the device, which could make the whole undertaking a lot easier. It should be enough to:\n",
    "\n",
    " - find the initial timestamps of both signals\n",
    " - [tests - autocorrelation, correlation in time]\n",
    " - visualize them\n",
    " - adjust or remove hypnogram datapoints outside of common recording time\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point it's important to remember that the devices recorded signal with different sampling rate, `125 Hz` for NeuroOn and `200 Hz` for AURA."
